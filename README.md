# flashcards

The objective of this project is to build a desktop and mobile app that creates flashcards based on user's interests and questions.

This is a Maven application, so you need to have Maven installed in your local machine. In order to run the app you need to execute `mvn clean javafx:run` in the root directory of this project. The `javafx` word is there because we need JavaFX to build the interface.
